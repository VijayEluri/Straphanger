------ HOW TO USE ------

The first thing the app will need to do is to download a significant amount of data
from the MBTA server.  This data has to do with where all the bus stops are, and what
busses stop at each on, and where those busses go.

You can start this process by hitting the "Regenerate Database" button.  This process
will take a while (about 15 minutes), and you might want to have the phone plugged in,
and make sure you have good service (3G or wifi).


Once the database is loaded, you can check on busses in two ways.

"Nearby Busses"  This will present you with a map.  If you have GPS service, it will indicate
your position with a small blue dot.  If not, it will start you off in downtown Boston.
Double-tap on the location you're interested in, and the app will show you all nearby busses
that are leaving soon.

"Load Profile"  If you have previously saved a "profile" (see below), this will show you all
of the busses in your profile that are leaving soon.



A "profile" is simply a list of busses that you have interest in.  For example, you might be
in Union Square and want to get to the subway to get into Boston.  You could equally well take
the 85 to Kendall, the 86 to Harvard, the 86 to Sullivan, the 87 to Lechmere, the 91 to Sullivan, 
the 91 to Central, the CT2 to Sullivan, or the CT2 to Kendall.  You could set up a profile that
allows you can check on these busses and only these busses.  Any number of profiles can be set up, 
for whatever recurring use you have: "Union Sq. to Subway", "Work to Home", etc.

You can create new profiles or edit existing ones.  In either case, the workflow is to add a 
batch of busses by picking a location, then pruning down that list by removing whichever busses
you're not interested in.
