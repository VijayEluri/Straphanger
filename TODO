Near Term: 
Parameterize prediction request instead of hard-coding from Union Sq.
Use "epochTime" instead of minutes
Count down time on screen instead of "freezing" at last update
Refresh every 30 seconds or so, but only when active on screen

Longer Term:
Allow lists of "favorites" (e.g. "Home to work", "Work to home", "Busses from Sullivan")
Allow editing of favorites by showing all busses stopping near a location (picked from map or GPS current location)
