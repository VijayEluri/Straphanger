Near Term: 
Use "epochTime" instead of minutes
Count down time on screen instead of "freezing" at last update
Refresh every 30 seconds or so, but only when active on screen

Longer Term:
Allow lists of "favorites" (e.g. "Home to work", "Work to home", "Busses from Sullivan")
Allow editing of favorites by showing all busses stopping near a location (picked from map or GPS current location)
