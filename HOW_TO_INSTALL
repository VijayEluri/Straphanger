------ HOW TO INSTALL ------


This app has not yet been added to the Google Market, nor is there yet a standalone package.
It must be built from source code and installed manually to your Android device.

1) Make sure your phone will accept apps installed from your computer.  On your phone, go to 
"settings", then "Applications".  Check to enable "Unknown Sources".  You may also want go to
"Development" and check to enable USB debugging.


2) Next, you need to have a computer with the Android SDK installed.  You can download the SDK,
and learn how to install and use it here:

http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html


3) Next, you need to have git (a version control system) installed on your computer.  If you don't
already have it, you can get it here:

http://git-scm.com/


4) Now, you can get the source code for the app.  Make a directory in any convenient location, and 
from that directory, run this command:

git clone git://github.com/tommywalsh/Straphanger.git


5) Now that you've got the code, you need to set it up for building with whatever SDK you have.  
Go to the "Straphanger" directory (which was created in step #4), and run this command:

android update project -p $(pwd)


6) Finally, install the app!  Run this command from the same directory:

ant install




This app is free software released under the GPL, which means you can feel free to make any
changes to it that you'd like.
